<h1>Overview</h1>
This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating health insurance premiums using key factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and medical history. The goal is to provide an accurate and efficient solution for assessing insurance costs.

The project consists of multiple phases, with the initial phase focusing on building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

<h1>Features</h1>
      1) Predictive Accuracy: Ensures a high accuracy rate with minimal error margins.

      2) Cloud Deployment: The model is accessible remotely for ease of use.

      3) Interactive Application: Provides a user-friendly interface for input and prediction.
